               Marvel comics data are retrieved from the Marvel Comics web API and used to help fill in fields.
               &lt;li&gt;
You can also add in comics that are non-Marvel, but you will need to enter all data by hand.
               &lt;li&gt;
You type something like &quot;Spider-Man&quot; or &quot;Hulk&quot; in the &quot;Series&quot; field and then the Marvel service is used to get all series starting with that text.
It then fills up the &quot;Title&quot; list with those titles.
               &lt;li&gt;
If you pick a title then it uses the Marvel service to get all the issues under that title and fills up the &quot;Issue Title&quot; dropdown.
               &lt;li&gt;
You then hit &quot;Add this issue&quot; and a dialog pops up - some of the values are filled in by Marvel but you can change them.
               &lt;li&gt;
Then &quot;OK&quot; and the issue is added to the list.
               &lt;li&gt;
To use &quot;Find title&quot;, start typing and the dropdown will be populated from the issues in your database. Pick a title and that title is loaded.
&lt;/ul&gt;"
